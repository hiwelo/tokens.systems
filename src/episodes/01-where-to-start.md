Is there a better way to start this project than discussing _where to start_.

For this first episode, I want to share with you my experience of starting a
design system project in a startup environment, within a small design team and
limited resources in the engineering space.

Starting a design systems project in such environment is a marathon, where you 
constantly have to balance the end goal, your own wishes and the reality of the
resources available.
How to convince your stakeholders of the benefits? Where to find support? How to
fix realistic goals and milestones? 

Let's discuss all of that, and the
importance to identify the current pain points a design system can help to 
resolve.
